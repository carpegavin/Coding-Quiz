# The Opprobrious Js Quiz

## https://carpegavin.github.io/The-Opprobrious-JS-Quiz/

## The goal of this project was to do the following:
- Create a timed quiz on JS fundamentals that stores the user's high scores and logs and compares them to others' scores.

## The acceptance criteria were as follows:
- When the start button is clicked, a timer is started and the user is presented with a question.
- When the user answers a question, they are prompted to answer another question.
- If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all of the questions have been answered OR the timer reaches zero, the game ends.
- When the game ends, the user is prompted to enter their intials and score.

## To satisfy the requirements of the acceptance criteria I did the following:
- Created a framework using HTML and design using CSS.
- Set two separate JS files -- one for the logic and one for the questions and answers.
- Set const variables for buttons, questions/answers, divs and containers.
- Set a function to begin the timer 

- * This is as far as I have gotten. I am struggling to use JS to utilize the HTML framework which I have the questions and answers imbedded in.
